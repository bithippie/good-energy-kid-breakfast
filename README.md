# Kid-favorite Metabolism Promoting Breakfast Ideas for a Hectic Morning

## Background

Inspired by Dr. Casey Means' book, *Good Energy*, and a quest to find metabolism-promoting breakfast options for my children, 
I decided to compile a list of breakfasts for kids that are low in refined grains and sugars, promoting long-term health for future generations.

## Smoothies

- Smoothies made with pea protein powder: plant milk, chia seeds, and fruit. Keep half a dozen kinds of frozen fruit chunks in your freezer and let your kids pick what they want. Add nut butter too, if your kids are not allergic to it.

## Yogurt

- Fage 5% (Whole-Fat) Unflavored Yogurt: No sugar added, high in protein, and moderate in fat. Add honey and granola for sweetness and some carbs, and seasonal fruit or applesauce as time permits.

- Greek Yogurt Mix: Greek yogurt, flax seed, fruit (e.g. blueberries, strawberries, raspberries), local raw honey, organic ground turmeric, or ground cinnamon.

## Eggs
> [!TIP]
>
> Source Local Eggs! \
> A post on your town's Facebook page is a good way to learn which neighbors raise hens.

- Omelette: Local, free-range, or cage-free eggs. Use a quality cheese such as Swiss, Colby Jack, or Cheddar. Add a pinch of coarse sea salt and black pepper before cooking.
