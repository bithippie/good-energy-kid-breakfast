# Kid-favorite Metabolism Promoting Breakfast Ideas for a Hectic Morning

## Background

Inspired by Dr. Casey Means' book, *Good Energy*, and the quest to find metabolism-promoting breakfast options for my children, 
I decided to compile a list of breakfasts for kids that are low in refined grains and sugars.

## Add to the List

If you have a recipe that you'd like to add, either open a PR or leave a comment on my [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bithippie_nutrition-breakfastideas-healthyeating-activity-7204488966199283712-CRHh). 

### Criteria:
- Kids' favorites
- Low blood sugar impact
- Reasonable prep time (approx. 5-10 minutes) for our already hectic mornings

## Smoothies

- Smoothies made with pea protein powder: plant milk, chia seeds, and fruit. Keep half a dozen kinds of frozen fruit chunks in your freezer and let your kids pick what they want. Add nut butter too, if your kids are not allergic to it.

## Yogurt

- Fage 5% (Whole-Fat) Unflavored Yogurt: No sugar added, high in protein, and moderate in fat. Add honey and granola for sweetness and some carbs, and seasonal fruit or applesauce as time permits.

- Greek Yogurt Mix: Greek yogurt, flax seed, fruit (e.g. blueberries, strawberries, raspberries), local raw honey, organic ground turmeric, or ground cinnamon.

## Eggs

- Omelette: Locally sourced eggs*. Use a quality cheese such as Swiss, Colby Jack, or Cheddar. Add a pinch of coarse sea salt and black pepper before cooking.
