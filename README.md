# Kid-favorite Metabolism Promoting Breakfast Ideas for a Hectic Morning

## Background

Inspired by Dr. Casey Means' book - [Good Energy][1], Shawn Stevenson's book - [Eat Smarter][2], and a desire to find metabolism-promoting breakfast options for my children, 
I decided to compile a list of breakfasts for kids that are low in refined grains and sugars, promoting long-term health for future generations. 

## Criteria:
- Kids' favorites
- Low blood sugar impact
- Reasonable prep time (approx. 5-10 minutes) for our already hectic mornings

### Add to the List

If you have a recipe that you'd like to add, either open a PR or leave a comment on my [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bithippie_nutrition-breakfastideas-healthyeating-activity-7204488966199283712-CRHh) and I'll add it to this document. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This is a community built list. \
> You may not agree every ingredient in every item on the list. \
> What ingredients people choose to cook with is a highly personal decision. \
> Peoples' bodies respond differently to different foods. \
> Remember, the goal is not to be perfect, but to make it easier to replace sugar-laden, inflammation-triggering convienece foods with healthier alternatives. \
> If you don't agree with something, submit an alternative recipe!

## Eggs
> [!TIP]
>
> When you can, source locally first! \
> A post on your town's Facebook page is a good way to learn which neighbors raise hens.

- Omelette: Local, free-range, or cage-free eggs. Use a quality cheese such as Swiss, Colby Jack, or Cheddar. Add a pinch of coarse sea salt and black pepper before cooking. 

## Smoothies

- Smoothies made with pea protein powder: plant milk, chia seeds, and fruit. Keep half a dozen kinds of frozen fruit chunks in your freezer and let your kids pick what they want. Add nut butter too, if your kids are not allergic to it.

## Breakfast Bars
Easy to make breakfast bars that can be eaten cold or warmed up.

### Ingredients
- 2 cups old fashioned oats
- 1.5 cups whole wheat flour
- 1/2 cup toasted wheat germ
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup honey
- 2/3 cup unsweetened apple sauce (we use two of the individual serving cups)
- 1/2 cup canola oil
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 2 egg whites, beaten
- 2/3 cup dried fruit (optional. 1/3 cup blueberries + 1/3 cup tart cherries from Trader Joes is our go-to)

### Cooking
- Preheat oven to 350f (325 convect)
- Combine dry ingredients in medium bowl
- Combine wet ingredients in large bowl, slowly mix in dry ingredients, fold in dried fruit if using
- Bake for 28 minutes in 13x9 baking dish that has been coated with non-stick spray
